This research paper explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for categorizing insect images. The study's main objective is to develop a CNN model capable of accurately identifying insects as harmful or beneficial based solely on their images. This classification is crucial for understanding insects' impact on both human activities and natural ecosystems.

Key aspects of the research include:

- **Data Analysis and Processing**: Utilizing a large dataset of insect images from the Natural History Museum in London.
- **CNN Implementation**: Employing CNNs to learn and recognize patterns and features unique to different insect species.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy in classifying insects, which holds significant potential for environmental management, agriculture, and biological research.

The dataset consists of high-resolution images from the British carabids collection at the Natural History Museum, London. It encompasses a total of 63,364 specimens across 291 species, with each species organized into folders labeled with their GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) number. For example, the species 'Carabus problematicus' is stored in the folder labeled '4470555'. The GBIF is a global initiative supporting biological and environmental research by providing open access to data on all life forms on Earth.

The dataset is structured with columns for the GBIF identification number (insect_gbif), the file path of the image (path_img), and the name of the image file (file_name).

This study aims to contribute significantly to automated image classification in entomology, offering a tool for rapid and precise identification of insect species, thereby enhancing our understanding and management of these vital components of our ecosystem.
